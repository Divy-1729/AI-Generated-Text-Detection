# AI vs Human Text Dataset

## Overview

This folder contains the "AI vs Human Text" dataset, which comprises approximately 500,000 essays, both AI-generated and human-written. The data has been collected from multiple sources and consolidated to facilitate research in distinguishing between AI-generated and human-authored text.

## Dataset Structure

- **ai_texts/**: Directory containing essays generated by various AI models.
- **human_texts/**: Directory containing essays written by humans.
- **metadata.csv**: A CSV file providing metadata for each essay, including:
  - `filename`: Name of the file.
  - `source`: Origin of the text (AI model name or human author details).
  - `length`: Word count of the essay.
  - `label`: Classification label (`AI` or `Human`).

## Usage

Researchers and developers can utilize this dataset to train and evaluate models aimed at detecting AI-generated text. Potential applications include:

- **Model Training**: Developing classifiers to differentiate between AI and human-written content.
- **Benchmarking**: Assessing the performance of existing AI text detectors.
- **Linguistic Analysis**: Studying differences in language patterns between AI-generated and human-authored texts.
